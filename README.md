# EmailApiBundle
This is a Symfony 2 Framework Bundle. The objective of this bundle is to provide an agnostic way to comunicate with several different email APIs. This means that the comunication logic is unified and in each API case the specifics are worked over to achieve the same goals.

With this, a tool is provided to comunicate with, for example, the Google Email API (Gmail) and the Microsoft Email API (Outlook) without the need to distinguish between the two. All you need to focus on is your objectives.

# Development
Development is starting with the Google Email API (Gmail) and as it progresses so will this section.

# Contributions
Right now the project is still very raw and incomplete. When there is a more defined path and a more solid foundation, we will update this with some guidelines.
